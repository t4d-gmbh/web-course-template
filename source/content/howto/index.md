./conditional_content

<!-- BUILDING THE PAGES -->
```{include} ./structure.md
```
```{include} ./combining.md
```
To do so we can follow this approach:

```{include} ./page_content.md
```
```{include} ./page_index.md
```
And here is how a full `ðŸ“‚mypage/ðŸ“„index.md` could look like: 
```{include} ./page_example.md
```
Finally, we still need to include the page:
```{include} ./page_import.md
```
```{include} ./conditional_content.md
```
